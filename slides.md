# Build in a Weekend. Scale to Millions.

> "Supabase is open source. We choose open source tools which are scalable and make them simple to use."

### What is Supabase?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8 mt-8 text-left">
<div>

- **The open-source Firebase alternative** built on Postgres
- Everything you need to build and scale apps

</div>
<div>

- Fully integrated, yet modular
- **No lock-in** — open source all the way down

</div>
</div>

<!--
Before we dive into testing, let me quickly introduce Supabase for those who haven't used it yet.

Supabase is an open-source backend platform. Think of it as 'Firebase, but with Postgres.' It gives you everything you need to build a product: database, authentication, file storage, edge functions, realtime subscriptions.

The key difference? It's built on Postgres — the world's most advanced open-source database with 30+ years of active development. And because it's open source, there's no vendor lock-in. You can self-host or migrate anytime.
-->

---

# What's in Supabase?

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Database** | Full Postgres with 50+ extensions (pgvector, PostGIS, etc.) |
| **Auth** | Email/password, OAuth, Magic Links, Enterprise SSO |
| **Storage** | S3-compatible file storage with RLS |
| **Edge Functions** | Server-side TypeScript/Deno at the edge |
| **Realtime** | WebSockets for live updates & multiplayer |
| **Auto-generated APIs** | REST and GraphQL from your schema |

<!--
Here's what you get with Supabase:

A full Postgres database — not a simplified version. Full postgres-level access with extensions like pgvector for AI, PostGIS for geospatial.

Authentication — complete auth system with social logins, magic links, even enterprise SSO.

Storage — S3-compatible file storage that integrates with your database security.

Edge Functions — run server-side code in Deno at the edge.

Realtime — WebSocket connections for live updates.

Auto-generated APIs — PostgREST turns your schema into REST APIs automatically. No backend code needed for CRUD.

The important thing for today's talk: all of this runs locally. The same Docker images. The same services. That's what makes testing against the real backend possible.

```

</div>

**All open source. All running locally.**

<!--
This is the Supabase architecture. Notice something important: everything flows through Postgres.

Kong — the API gateway that routes requests
PostgREST — auto-generates REST APIs by reading your Postgres schema
GoTrue — handles authentication, stores users in auth.users (a Postgres table!)
Realtime — watches Postgres WAL for changes, broadcasts via WebSockets
Storage — stores file metadata in Postgres with RLS
Edge Functions — Deno runtime for custom logic

Why does this matter for testing? Because everything is Postgres-centric, when you test Postgres, you test everything. And these exact same Docker images run in production. Same code. Same behavior. That's production parity you can trust.

# Who Uses Supabase?

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12">
<div>

### From indie hackers to Fortune 500

- **5,000,000+** developers
- **93,000+** GitHub stars
- **16,000,000+** databases created
- **90,000+** databases launched daily
- More than half of every **Y Combinator** batch

</div>
<div>

### Notable users

Udio, Lovable, GitHub, Resend, Kayhan Space, Deriv, Mozilla, PWC, 1Password

</div>
</div>

<!--
Supabase isn't just for side projects. Look at these numbers:

5 million developers
93,000 GitHub stars — one of the fastest growing open source projects
16 million databases created

Companies like Udio (AI music), Lovable (AI dev tools), Mozilla, 1Password, PWC — they all use Supabase in production.

And here's a fun fact: more than half of every Y Combinator batch builds on Supabase. These are companies that need to move fast AND scale.

So when I tell you to test against a real Supabase backend, I'm talking about the same infrastructure running millions of requests for real companies.

# The Problem with Mocks

> "Testing is a critical part of database development, especially when working with features like Row Level Security (RLS) policies."

<!--
Let's be honest - mocks are lies we tell ourselves. They make tests pass, but they don't catch real bugs.
-->

---
layout: center
class: text-center
---

# Why JavaScript Mocks Fall Short

<div class="text-left max-w-2xl mx-auto text-xl space-y-4">

- Mock behavior may not match reality
- **Can't test RLS** - it's SQL evaluated by Postgres
- **Can't test constraints** - enforced by the database
- Requires maintenance when API changes

</div>

<!--
Here's what JavaScript mocks CAN'T test:

Row Level Security - RLS policies are SQL rules evaluated by Postgres at query time. A JavaScript mock just returns fake data - it doesn't execute SQL.

Database constraints - Foreign keys, unique constraints, check constraints - these are enforced by Postgres, not your mock.

Real auth flows - JWT validation, session management, token refresh - mocks just return what you tell them to.
-->

---

# The Supabase Solution

> "The Supabase CLI enables you to run the entire Supabase stack locally, on your machine or in a CI environment."

### Two commands to get started:

```bash
supabase init    # Create a new local project
supabase start   # Launch the Supabase services
```

<!--
This is the magic of Supabase - two commands and you have the ENTIRE production stack running locally. Not a simplified version. Not a mock. The actual services.

Why is this possible? Because Supabase is built on open source tools:
- Postgres - The world's most advanced open source database (30+ years of development)
- PostgREST - Auto-generates REST APIs from your database
- GoTrue - JWT-based authentication
- Realtime - WebSocket server for live updates
- Kong - API gateway

These same Docker images run in production. Same code. Same behavior. That's production parity you can trust.
-->

---

# What You Get Locally

```
Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
     Mailpit URL: http://localhost:54324
   Publishable Key: sb_publishable_...
        Secret Key: sb_secret_...
```

<!--
Look at what you get! This isn't a toy - it's a full backend. The keys work exactly like in production. Your client code doesn't change between local and production - just the URL.
-->

---

# Full Stack Included

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12 text-xl">
<div>

- **Postgres** - Real database, not a mock
- **Auth (GoTrue)** - Complete authentication
- **Storage** - File storage with RLS
- **Realtime** - WebSocket connections

</div>
<div>

- **Edge Functions** - Deno runtime
- **Studio** - Visual dashboard
- **Mailpit** - Email testing

</div>
</div>

<!--
A real Postgres database - with pgvector, PostGIS, and 50+ extensions available
Real authentication - sign up, sign in, OAuth, magic links - it all works
Mailpit - catches all emails locally so you can test password resets, magic links, confirmations
Studio - a full visual dashboard to inspect your data, run SQL, manage users

This is the same architecture used by companies running millions of requests. You're testing against production-grade infrastructure.
-->

---

# Local Development Benefits

<div class="text-xl space-y-6">

1. **Faster development** - Make changes and see results instantly

2. **Offline work** - Continue development without internet

3. **Cost-effective** - Local development is free

</div>

<!--
Speed - No network latency. Queries return in milliseconds. Hot reload your migrations.

Offline - On a plane? No wifi? Still productive. Your whole backend runs locally.

Free - No usage limits locally. Spin up 10 projects, run thousands of tests, costs nothing.
-->

---

# Local Development Benefits (cont.)

<div class="text-xl space-y-6">

4. **Enhanced privacy** - Sensitive data stays on your machine

5. **Easy testing** - Experiment without affecting production
   - Reset with `supabase db reset`

</div>

<!--
Privacy - Building something with sensitive data? It never leaves your machine during development.

Experimentation - Try crazy things. Break stuff. Reset with supabase db reset. No consequences.

The key insight: the local environment IS the production environment, just running on your machine. When you deploy, you're deploying the same thing you tested.
-->

---

# "Can't I Just Use Docker + Postgres?"

**Yes!** RLS and pgTAP work with any Postgres.

**What Supabase adds:**

- `supabase start` → Full stack in one command
- `supabase test db` → pgTAP with nice output
- `auth.uid()` → Pre-built JWT helper
- Auth, Storage, Realtime → Pre-configured
- Production hosting when you're ready

<!--
This is an honest question and deserves an honest answer. Yes, you could set up Docker + Postgres + pgTAP + your own auth system + your own JWT helpers.

Supabase just gives you that stack pre-integrated with a nice CLI. The value is convenience and production-readiness, not magic features.
-->

---

# Two Testing Approaches

| Approach | Tool | Isolation | Speed |
|----------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Database-level** | pgTAP | Transactions (auto-rollback) | Milliseconds |
| **Application-level** | Vitest/Jest | Unique IDs per test | Fast |

<div class="mt-8">

**Use both for complete coverage:**
- pgTAP for security logic (RLS, permissions)
- Application tests for end-to-end flows

</div>

<!--
Supabase gives you TWO complementary ways to test:

pgTAP (Database-level) - Tests run INSIDE Postgres. They're wrapped in transactions that automatically rollback. This means:
- Tests run in milliseconds
- Perfect isolation - no cleanup needed
- Direct access to test RLS policies

Application tests (Vitest/Jest) - Tests run from your app code, calling the real API. Use unique IDs for isolation.

Use pgTAP for security logic (RLS, permissions). Use application tests for end-to-end flows. Together, they give you complete coverage.
-->

---

# pgTAP - A Postgres Testing Framework

> pgTAP is a **PostgreSQL tool** (since 2008) - works with any Postgres database.

Supabase makes it easy: `supabase test db`

<div class="mt-6">

**Think of it as Jest/Vitest but for SQL**

- Test database structure, RLS policies, functions
- Tests run inside Postgres in transactions
- Automatic rollback = perfect isolation

</div>

<!--
pgTAP has been around since 2008. It's not a Supabase thing - it works with any Postgres database.

What Supabase adds: the supabase test db command that runs pgTAP tests with nice output formatting.

Why this matters: RLS policies are SQL evaluated by Postgres. You CANNOT properly test RLS from JavaScript - you need to test at the database level. pgTAP lets you do that.
-->

---

# Row Level Security - A Postgres Feature

> RLS is a **PostgreSQL feature**. Supabase makes it easy to use with `auth.uid()` and client SDKs.

### Why RLS changes everything:

- Security at the **database level**, not application level
- Works with **any client** - REST, GraphQL, direct SQL
- **Defense in depth** - even if your API is compromised

<!--
RLS is a core PostgreSQL feature - not something Supabase invented. What Supabase adds is convenience: the auth.uid() helper function that extracts the user ID from JWTs, and client SDKs that handle authentication.

Traditional approach: Your API checks permissions, then queries the database. Problem: Every API endpoint is a potential security hole.

With RLS: Policies enforce permissions AT THE DATABASE. The API doesn't need to know about permissions - Postgres handles it.

The policy using ((select auth.uid()) = user_id) means: 'Only return rows where the user_id matches the authenticated user's ID.' This runs on EVERY query. You can't bypass it.
-->

---

# Example Schema - Todos with RLS

```sql
-- Create a simple todos table
create table todos (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  task text not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null,
  completed boolean default false
);

-- Enable RLS
alter table todos enable row level security;

-- Create a policy
create policy "Users can only access their own todos"
  on todos for all
  to authenticated
  using ((select auth.uid()) = user_id);
```

<!--
Let's look at a real example. This is a todos table with RLS.

Notice: alter table todos enable row level security. This is CRITICAL. Without it, the table is public.

The policy says: 'For ALL operations (select, insert, update, delete), only allow access to authenticated users, and only for rows where the user_id equals the current user's ID.'

auth.uid() is a Supabase helper function that extracts the user ID from the JWT. It's evaluated at query time.

Key insight: We wrap it in (select auth.uid()) instead of just auth.uid(). This is a performance optimization from the docs - it caches the result per statement instead of evaluating per row.
-->

---

# Creating a pgTAP Test

```bash
# Create a new test file
supabase test new todos_rls
```

Creates: `supabase/tests/todos_rls.test.sql`

<div class="mt-8">

**Pro tip:** Create a `000-setup.test.sql` file for shared extensions and helpers

</div>

<!--
The CLI makes it easy. supabase test new scaffolds a test file for you.

Tests go in supabase/tests/. They're SQL files that run in order (alphabetically).

Pro tip from the docs: Create a 000-setup.test.sql file that installs shared extensions and test helpers. It runs first because of the naming convention.
-->

---

# pgTAP Test - Setup

```sql
begin;
create extension if not exists pgtap with schema extensions;
select plan(4);

-- Setup test users
insert into auth.users (id, email) values
  ('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', 'user1@test.com'),
  ('987fcdeb-51a2-43d7-9012-345678901234', 'user2@test.com');

-- Create test todos
insert into public.todos (task, user_id) values
  ('User 1 Task 1', '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'),
  ('User 1 Task 2', '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'),
  ('User 2 Task 1', '987fcdeb-51a2-43d7-9012-345678901234');
```

<!--
begin; starts a transaction - everything happens in isolation.

select plan(4); tells pgTAP we're running 4 tests.

We insert test users directly into auth.users - only possible in tests!
-->

---

# pgTAP Test - Assertions

```sql
-- Test as User 1
set local role authenticated;
set local request.jwt.claim.sub = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000';

-- User 1 should only see their own todos
select results_eq(
  'select count(*) from todos',
  ARRAY[2::bigint],
  'User 1 should only see their 2 todos'
);

-- Switch to User 2 and test...
set local request.jwt.claim.sub = '987fcdeb-51a2-43d7-9012-345678901234';

select * from finish();
rollback;
```

<!--
set local role authenticated - simulates an authenticated user.

set local request.jwt.claim.sub - sets which user we're pretending to be. This is how auth.uid() knows who's making the request.

rollback - undo everything. Database is clean for next test.
-->

---

# Running pgTAP Tests

```bash
supabase test db
```

Output:

```
supabase/tests/todos_rls.test.sql .. ok
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=4,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.01 CPU)
Result: PASS
```

**Key point:** Tests wrapped in transactions = automatic rollback!

<!--
One command: supabase test db. That's it.

Look at that output - 0.01 seconds for 4 tests. These aren't slow integration tests. This is the speed of unit tests with the accuracy of integration tests.

The rollback at the end means:
- No test data pollutes your database
- Tests can run in any order
- Tests are completely isolated
- You can run the same test 1000 times, always the same result

Compare this to application tests that need database cleanup, unique IDs, and careful ordering. pgTAP is surgical.
-->

---

# Application-Level Testing

> "Testing through application code provides end-to-end verification. Unlike database-level testing with pgTAP, application-level tests cannot use transactions for isolation."

### Solution: Unique IDs per test suite

Each test suite owns its own "slice" of the database

<!--
pgTAP is great for RLS, but sometimes you need to test the full flow - from your JavaScript code through the API to the database and back.

The challenge: Application tests can't use transactions for isolation. They make HTTP requests that each run in their own database transaction.

The solution from the docs: Unique identifiers per test suite. Generate a unique ID at the start of your test, use it in all test data. Tests don't conflict because each suite has its own namespace.

Think of it as each test suite owning its own 'slice' of the database.
-->

---

# Application Test - Setup

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'
import { beforeAll, describe, expect, it } from 'vitest'
import crypto from 'crypto'

describe('Todos RLS', () => {
  // Generate unique IDs for this test suite
  const USER_1_ID = crypto.randomUUID()
  const USER_2_ID = crypto.randomUUID()

  const supabase = createClient(
    process.env.SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!  // or SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  )
```

---

# Application Test - beforeAll

```typescript
  beforeAll(async () => {
    const adminSupabase = createClient(
      process.env.SUPABASE_URL!,
      process.env.SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY!  // or SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
    )

    // Create test users with unique IDs
    await adminSupabase.auth.admin.createUser({
      id: USER_1_ID,
      email: `user1-${USER_1_ID}@test.com`,
      password: 'password123',
      email_confirm: true,
    })

    // Create initial todos
    await adminSupabase.from('todos').insert([
      { task: 'User 1 Task 1', user_id: USER_1_ID },
      { task: 'User 1 Task 2', user_id: USER_1_ID },
    ])
  })
```

---

# Application Test - Real Auth

```typescript
  it('should allow User 1 to only see their own todos', async () => {
    // Real authentication
    await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: `user1-${USER_1_ID}@test.com`,
      password: 'password123',
    })

    // Real query against real database
    const { data: todos } = await supabase.from('todos').select('*')

    expect(todos).toHaveLength(2)
    todos?.forEach((todo) => {
      expect(todo.user_id).toBe(USER_1_ID)
    })
  })
```

---

# Application Test - Negative Case

```typescript
  it('should prevent User 2 from modifying User 1 todos', async () => {
    await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: `user2-${USER_2_ID}@test.com`,
      password: 'password123',
    })

    // Attempt to update - will be a no-op due to RLS
    await supabase.from('todos')
      .update({ task: 'Hacked!' })
      .eq('user_id', USER_1_ID)

    // Verify as User 1
    await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
      email: `user1-${USER_1_ID}@test.com`,
      password: 'password123',
    })

    const { data: todos } = await supabase.from('todos').select('*')
    todos?.forEach((todo) => {
      expect(todo.task).not.toBe('Hacked!')
    })
  })
})
```

---

# Test Isolation Strategies

> "Application-level tests should not rely on a clean database state, as resetting the database before each test can be slow and makes tests difficult to parallelize."

### Three strategies:

1. **Unique Identifiers** - Generate unique IDs for each test suite
2. **Cleanup After Tests** - Clean up in `afterAll` or `afterEach` hooks
3. **Isolated Data Sets** - Use prefixes or namespaces

---

# CI/CD Integration

```yaml
name: Database Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Supabase CLI

      - name: Start Supabase
        run: supabase start
      - name: Run Tests
        run: supabase test db
```

# Best Practices: Test Data

### Test Data Setup
- Use `begin` and `rollback` for isolation
- Create realistic test data
- Test with different user roles

---

# Best Practices: RLS & CI/CD

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-12">
<div>

### RLS Policy Testing
- Test CRUD operations
- Test with anon AND authenticated
- **Always test negative cases**

</div>
<div>

### CI/CD Integration
- Run tests on every PR
- Keep tests fast using transactions

</div>
</div>

---

# Advanced - Test Helpers

```sql
-- Install test helpers
select dbdev.install('basejump-supabase_test_helpers');
create extension if not exists "basejump-supabase_test_helpers";

-- Simplified user management
select tests.create_supabase_user('user1@test.com');
select tests.authenticate_as('user1@test.com');
select tests.get_supabase_uid('user1@test.com');

-- Verify RLS across entire schema
select tests.rls_enabled('public');
```

# Live Demo: Testing Project

```
demo-testing/
├── supabase/
│   ├── migrations/   # Schema + RLS policies
│   └── tests/        # pgTAP tests
├── src/tests/        # Vitest application tests
└── package.json
```

**Two test commands:**

```bash
npm run test:db   # pgTAP (database-level)
npm test          # Vitest (application-level)
```

**Code:** [github.com/mandarini/demo-testing-supabase](https://github.com/mandarini/demo-testing-supabase)

<!--
Let me show you a real project structure. This is the demo-testing project - a simple todos app with RLS.

The migrations folder has our schema and RLS policies. The tests folder has pgTAP tests that run inside Postgres. And src/tests has Vitest tests that call the real API.

Two commands: test:db for database tests, test for application tests.

<!--
That's how you stop mocking and start testing with real Supabase backends. The combination of pgTAP for database-level tests and application tests with real auth gives you complete coverage with production parity. Thank you for your attention - I'd love to answer any questions you have!
